component: switch
Given: switch is connected to a power cable (one cable in, one cable out)
       switch is connected to control_unit
When:  control_unit sends a continuous "on" signal
Then:  switch lets current flow between the two power cables

Given: switch is connected to a power cable (one cable in, one cable out)
       switch is connected to control_unit
When:  no signal is received from switch
Then:  no current flows betewwn the two power cables

Given: switch is connected to a power cable (one cable in, one cable out)
       switch is not connected to control_unit
When:  always
Then:  no current flows betewwn the two power cables


Core:  physical device (relay)
       specs:...
Adapter OUT: wires screwed on the device
Adaper 	IN:  beadbord


component: control_unit
Given: control_unit is connected to switch
       control_unit is connected to power_supply
       control_unit is connected to switcher
When:  switcher sends an "on" signal
Then:  control_unit start sending a continuous "on" signal to switch

Given: control_unit is connected to switch
       control_unit is connected to power_supply
       control_unit is connected to switcher
       control_unit is sending a continuous "on" signal to switch
When:  switcher sends an "off" signal 
Then:  control_unit stops senting a continuous "on" signal to switch

Given: control_unit is connected to switch
       control_unit is connected to power_supply
       control_unit is connected to switcher
       control_unit is not sending a continuous "on" signal to switch
When:  switcher sends an "off" signal 
Then:  control_unit doesn't change its status

Given: control_unit is connected to switch
       control_unit is connected to power_supply
       control_unit is connected to switcher
       control_unit is sending a continuous "on" signal to switch
When:  switcher sends an "on" signal 
Then:  control_unit doesn't change its status

Core:   arduino uno
Adapter OUT: beadboard
Adapter	IN:  usb connection
	     some kind of library to connect arduino to python

component: switcher
Given: switcher is connected to control_unit
       switcher is connected to scheduler
When:  scheduler sends an "on[/off]" signal to swicher
Then:  switcher sends an "on[/off]" signal to control_unit

Given: switcher is connected to control_unit
       switcher is connected to user_control
When:  user_control sends an "on[/off]" signal to swicher
Then:  switcher sends an "on[/off]" signal to control_unit

Core:  python service 
Adapter OUT:  usb connection
	      some kind of library to connect arduino to python
Adapter	IN:   periodically reads content of a file
	      (...messaging service in the future?)

component: scheduler
Given: scheduler is connected to control_unit
       scheduler is connected to user_control
When:  user_control sends an "on[/off]" signal to swicher
Then:  switcher sends an "on[/off]" signal to control_unit
